**[sp-client-document-manager]** 

This shortcode displays the uploader
 
**[cdm-link file="x" date="1" real="1"]**
* This links to a specific file

* file = required, this is the file id. You can find the file id in admin under files or by clicking on a file. The ID is listed next to the date.
* date = (set to 1) optional, show the date of a file
* real = (set to 1) optional, generate the real url for the file, the link tags are not generated and only the url is returned. This is good for custom links and image url's

examples:

* [cdm-link file="53" date="1"]
* Will generate a link with the file name and date

'< img src="[cdm-link file="53" real="1"]" width="100">'

**[cdm-project project="x" date="1" order="x" direction="x" limit="x" ]**

This shortlink will display a unordered list of files, it is a basic html ul so you can use css to display it however you want.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How come I'm getting a 404 error? =

This could be one of two reasons, either you did not install theme my login or you're running wordpress in a directory in which you can go to settings and set the directory for wordpress.

= Why am I just getting a spinning circle and no content on my uploader? = 

This is usually because you are using a theme that converts new lines into paragraphs. To fix this wrap the short code in raw tags. Example: [raw][sp-client-document-manager] [/raw]

= Is there a conflict with another plugin? =

Sometimes plugins have conflicts, if you are experiencing any abnormal problems there could be a javascript error. Please download and install firebug to find the issue.

= I get an imagemagick error when creating thumbnails of pdf and psd's = 

Imagemagick is a 3rd party plugin you are responsible for, it needs to be downloaded and installed on your server but more importantly, it needs to be compiled into php. Your server admin should be able to handle that, we do not support imagemagick installations.

= I'm using the premium version but not seeing the client document uploader tab in wordpress =

Premium users must have free + premium version installed. The premium extends the free version. Once you install the free version you will see the tab, from there put in your serial code.
= Do you offer capabilities for user roles? = 

* sp_cdm = You need this role to view the plugin, this is a very minimal role. You can view files, edit and delete.
* sp_cdm_settings = edit settings as well as enable any premium plugin features (in the future we will break premium features into their own roles, just getting started here)
* sp_cdm_vendors = Show vendors tab
* sp_cdm_projects = Show projects tab
* sp_cdm_uploader = Use the uploader (add files)

= Why am I getting a permission denied error when activating the premium or trial version? = 

The premium version relies on common functions to operate, please activate the FREE version to fix this error. You must have both FREE and Premium plugins installed and activated.
